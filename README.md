# float_tracker

This package contains Python scripts and notebooks used to process and plot data for the paper "3D-printed machines that manipulate microscopic objects using capillary forces" by Zeng*, Faaborg*, et al. 


`float_tracker.py`, `COM_concat.py`, `COM_plotter.py` were used to track the position and angle of floats.

profilometry > `rawdata-to-meshgrid.ipynb` was used to convert raw surface profilometry data (in mm) to an 11mm x 11mm meshgrid. 

force-displacement > `Rough_CapillaryForce_MajorAxis_analysis_v2_github.ipynb` was used to process and plot data from a custom-built force measurement apparatus.
